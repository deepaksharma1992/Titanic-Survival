# Titanic-Survival

This project predicts the survival rate of the Titanic ship passengers.
This data is easily available on Kaggle website and can be downloaded from there.
This is an classification problem where our Machine Learning model will determine weather the passenger will survive the titanic crash or not.

To run this project, run the Titanic Survival.ipynb file in either Jupyter notebook or in Google Colabs notebook using either Pthon 2 or 3 environment.

Classification models used in this datasets are-
1. LogisticRegresssion Classifier
2. Support Vector Machine Classifier
3. Decision Tree Classifier
4. Randomforest Classifier
5. AdaBoost Classifier


Techonlogies Used in This Project
1. Pandas 
2. Numpy 
3. Sklearn Machine learning
